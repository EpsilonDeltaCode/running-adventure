# running-adventure
An App that makes your running exercise much more fun

This app should become a companion for boring running exercises by
creating a randomly generated route for you,
navigating you along the different destinations
and providing an interesting story.


## Changelog

- using the "nearest" service to not have random locations off road
- added some first tests to get a random route
- added a few basic classes
- Included the forked Osrm.Client into this project



### Using a modified(forked) Osrm.Client, originally from narfunikita from https://github.com/narfunikita/Osrm.Client
