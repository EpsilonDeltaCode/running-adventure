## Possible Problems

- [ ] a "new name" maneuver may change the direction and should be seen as a turn?
- [ ] merge, ramp (on/off) and fork maneuvers are ignored by now because they are rather irrelevant for runners
- [ ] "end of road" maneuver is also a turn
- [ ] "roundabout turn" should be treeted as a turn?
